Searchkit Cloud provides two public libraries:

- [cloud-sdk](./reference/api) Node API which transforms instantsearch requests into Elasticsearch queries
- [instantsearch-client](./reference/client) that integrates with the instantsearch library and the Searchkit's SDK.

With the SDK, you'll be able to use instantsearch frameworks to quickly build great search experiences with **Elasticsearch**.
