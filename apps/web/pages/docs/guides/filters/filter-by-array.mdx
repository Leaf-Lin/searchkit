title: Filtering of Arrays
---

You can filter your search results by array of string values. This is useful for filtering by documents with many authors or tags.

## Setup a String field

To filter by string, you must first add a keyword to your index.

Indexing the following document into Elasticsearch will create a `tags` field that can be used for filtering.

```json
{
  "tags": ["ecommerce", "FW23"]
}
```

and your mapping will look like this:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "tags": {
      "type": "text",
      "fields": {
        "keyword": {
          "type": "keyword"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Filter Attribute Configuration

Add a filter attribute to your index configuration. The filter attribute will be used to filter your search results by date.

```ts
 {
  "filter_attributes": [
    { attribute: 'tags', field: 'tags.keyword', type: 'string' },
  ]
 }

```

Alternatively, you can also add the attribute under `facet_attributes` to make it available for faceting.

```ts
 {
  "facet_attributes": [
    { attribute: 'tags', field: 'tags.keyword', type: 'string' }
  ]
 }

```

The attribute name must be unique in both `filter_attributes` and `facet_attributes`. If you want to use the same attribute for both filtering and faceting, add it to `facet_attributes` only.

## Using Filter Attributes

You can use the filter attribute in your search query to filter your search results by date within `configure`.


### Syntax Examples
Filters must follow the [Elasticsearch Query String](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html) format.

```js
 "tags:ecommerce" # author is John
 "author:ecommerce OR tags:fw23" # author is John or Jane
```

### Example

```js
 client.configure({
  filters: 'tags:ecommerce'
 })
```
