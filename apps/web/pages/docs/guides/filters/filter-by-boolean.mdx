title: Filter by boolean value
---

You can filter your search results by boolean. For example, you can filter your search results by `in_stock` to only show in stock products.

## Setup a boolean field

To filter by boolean value, you must first set up a boolean field. 

Indexing the following document into Elasticsearch will create a boolean field called `in_stock`:

```json
{
  "in_stock": true
}
```

and your mapping will look like this:

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "in_stock": {
        "type": "boolean"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Filter Attribute Configuration

Add a filter attribute to your index configuration. The filter attribute will be used to filter your search results by in stock flag.

```ts
 {
  "filter_attributes": [
    { attribute: 'in_stock', field: 'in_stock', type: 'string' },
  ]
 }
```

Alternatively, you could setup the attribute under `facet_attributes` to make it available for faceting.

```ts
 {
  "facet_attributes": [
    { attribute: 'in_stock', field: 'in_stock', type: 'string' },
  ]
 }

```

The attribute name must be unique in both `filter_attributes` and `facet_attributes`. If you want to use the same attribute for both filtering and faceting, add it to `facet_attributes` only.

## Using Filter Attributes

You can use the filter attribute in your search query to filter your search results by date within `configure`.

### Syntax Examples

```js
 "in_stock:true" # In stock is true
```
